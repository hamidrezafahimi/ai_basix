There are 4 main steps for implementation of a neural network in tensorflow-2:

1. Prepare and load the dataset

2. Create a *Model* object. This object contains: (a) The architecture of the solution (b) The training algorithm

3. Compile and create the *Model*

4. Train (the function *fit*), Test (the function *predict*), or Evaluate (the function *evaluate*)
