This can be both a starting point for the development of artificial neural network algorithms, and a handbook containing introductory to advanced tools and solutions in this field. I have recently started documenting everything I have learned (and am learning) in the area. Soon I'll develope it much more. 

## Summary of Resources

There are two major concepts covered:

### ANN Theory

Summary manuscripts (in the `notes` folder) resulted by passing these courses:

- An ANN course I had in 2020 in Amirkabir University of Technology - Dr Safabakhsh

### ANN Coding Samples - Tensorflow

A bunch of code samples exist which are my done homeworks during the ANN-Coding courses I have passed:

- Tensorflow-2 - Ahmad Asadi (Teaching Assistant Class for ANN course, safabakhsh, Amirkabir University of Technology) - [This Link]()
