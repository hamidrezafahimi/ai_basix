This can be both a starting point for the development of artificial neural network algorithms, and a handbook containing introductory to advanced tools and solutions in this field. I have recently started documenting everything I have learned (and am learning) in the area. Soon I'll develope it much more. 

## Usage

Explanations about the context of each directory:

First of all, my theoretic summaries are placed in the `notes/`. There are different text files each subjected to a specific topic with classification of the context in a table of contents at the beginning of each.

Elementary coding instructions based on different platforms are are placed in the `samples/` directory.If you are not much familiar to the basic concepts, in `samples/`, there are a bunch of code examples related to different known ANN developement platforms. So the scripts are classified based on the different platforms. For instance, I suggest the `samples/tensorflow/keras/` for a basic introduction to the artificial neural network design and implementation.

After all, the main helpful sample projects exist in `projects/`. Despite the `samples/` directory, the scripts are classified based on the main topic of each. Withing the sample codes, baisc instruction subjected to the specific topic are given in comments. 


## Summary of Resources

There are two major concepts covered:

### ANN Theory

Summary manuscripts (in the `notes` folder) resulted by passing these courses:

- An ANN course I had in 2020 in Amirkabir University of Technology - Dr Safabakhsh

- This [youtube video course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQY2H8rRoyvxWE6bWx8XiMvyZFgg_25Q_)


### ANN Coding Samples - Tensorflow

A bunch of code samples exist which are my done homeworks during the ANN-Coding courses I have passed:

- Tensorflow-2 - Ahmad Asadi (Teaching Assistant Class for ANN course, safabakhsh, Amirkabir University of Technology) - [This Link]()

### OpenAI gym

There are also samples of using the OpenAI gym environments for DRL. Sources:
