[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mut_u40Sqz4) gives a complete tutorial on the *stable_baselines* library (version 3) for nn-based reinforcement learning. I haven't already coded anything following its instruction. But [this](https://github.com/nicknochnack/ReinforcementLearningCourse) is the github repo for it. Also, I did my first trials with the openAI's *gym* library using the aforementioned tutorial. [Here](https://github.com/hamidrezafahimi/ai_basix/blob/master/platforms/gym) is the link to sample codes.
