## For Python

Go to [their website](https://pytorch.org). In the first page, there are instructions to install torch whether you want python or C++ API. 

A normal installation approach, includes simply using the following command:

```
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio
```

*NOTE:* At the time of writing this, the above command is proper for a `Linux - CUDA 11.7` config.

*NOTE:* If having connection problem while downloading the wheel in the terminal, refer [here](https://github.com/hamidrezafahimi/instructor_archive/tree/main/Linux/apps/pip.md) for instruction. The proper wheel can be found [here](https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple/torch/).
